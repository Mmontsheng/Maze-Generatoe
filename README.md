 "https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/010.1-maze-dfs-p5.html">The coding Train</a>


## Hacking
### Build
Base on java 11, ensure you have java running
This is a mvn project, so an `mvn clean package` should do.

### Runing
- `cd` into `target`
- Run `java -jar MazeGenerator-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
## TODO
- [X] Build a jar
- [ ] Dockerize 
- Have a docker file already, just having problems rendering the GUI of the maze
